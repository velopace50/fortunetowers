The metaverse is not about recreating the physical world, we're building a better slot machine gaming experience. A place where you can lose yourself for minutes or hours, that you'll come back to again and again. All our development effort will go towards creating compelling immersive slots game experiences."

            detail: "At present over 30% of activity in some of the generalist metaverses is people playing casino games.  We know slots are engaging so we're building a specific casino gaming metaverse.  We're focused on what we know works."

        {
            title: 'What about gambling regulations?',
            detail: "Most metaverse projects are currently ignoring gaming regulations hoping they can hide behind anonymity or claim they're just a platform. Although the games take part within a 3D environment using a token, they clearly fall under the definition of gambling of most national gaming regulators in the same way current online casinos do. Any arguments they're just a just providing a platform and other people are operating the casinos usually falls under well established facilitating gambling. Enforcement will and consequences will follow. Fortune Towers is divided into different towers with differing games that restrict players based on their jurisdiction. We'll be following all required gaming regulations and obtain gaming licences when and where necessary."
        },
        {
            title: 'How is the world divided?',
            detail: "The game world is logically divided up into Towers, these are tailored for the target audience, language and the types of games. Within each tower that are a number of spaces. A space is analogus to an individual casino area. An area contains a collection of games and players. Exploring a 3D space is only interesting for long periods if it's part of a broader game mechanic such as treasure hunt, tag or combat games. It's not intended that users will walk around to get to their game of choice as that gets boring after the initial novelty has worn off."

            title: 'Can I buy land?',
            detail: "There are dozens of metaverse projects that are offering parcels of 'land' as part of a broader contiguous map. We're not. Land is a construct from the physical world, it doesn't really make sense to us within the digital world. However, spaces are available. These contain a collections of games and players with rules within the space."

In the future may offer this with new Towers of game spaces, but it's not where our development effort will be focused initially as we don't feel it adds anything to the core slots experience."

            title: 'Is the world ready for the generic Metaverses?',
            detail: "Perhaps not as some people are currently envisaging. We believe lockdowns and super easy monetary policy has meant people have worked less and spent more time at home online than is the norm. This has pulled the discussion of the Metaverse forward quicker than otherwise would have happened and so it might disapoint in the near term. Our slot games our proven to be entertaining and playable in isolation. People play the games because they enjoy them. We'll stick to the core principle of making a fun entertaining experience then the underlying value of our platform will follow."
